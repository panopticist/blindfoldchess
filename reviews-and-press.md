<h1>Reviews & Press</h1>

<p><strong><em>New in Chess</em></strong>, the most widely read chess magazine in the world, called it "a truly magnificent and beautiful book on blindfold chess."</p>

<p>In its June 2009 issue, <strong><em>Chess Life</em></strong> praised the book in an extensive review. Here's an excerpt:</p>

<blockquote>
"A book of this importance to its subject is rare in any discipline… thorough, thoughtful, and scholarly—and, at the same time, very enjoyable to read…. Since I believe that true excellence must be rewarded, I hope plenty of readers will ... get the definitive work on blindfold chess—along with some wonderful chess reading."
</blockquote>

<p>On July 27, 2009, the <strong><em>London Evening Standard</em></strong> wrote that <em>Blindfold Chess</em> is "a brilliantly authoritative work ... a fascinating and enjoyable book."</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Robert Goldstone</strong>, the Chancellor's Professor of Psychological and Brain Sciences at Indiana University and the director of the school's cognitive science program, had this to say about the book:</p>

<blockquote>
"This is a tour de force scholarly achievement that will be of substantial interest not only to chess aficionados, but also to those who enjoy thinking about thinking itself. Hearst and Knott shed light on an extraordinary human cognitive ability through careful historical analysis and a compelling review of psychological studies and theories. This book not only documents, but goes a long way toward explaining, the amazing intellectual achievement of simultaneously playing 10, 20, or even 40 games of chess without being able to see any of them."
</blockquote>

<p>In an extensive May 2009 review on <strong>chesscafe.com</strong> entitled "The Magnum Opus of Blindfold Play," <strong>Steve Goldberg</strong> wrote the following:</p>

<blockquote>
It's not often that a chess book comes along that doesn't more or less cover the same ground as countless books before it, but this is such a book. The authors combine intellectual curiosity, scientific investigation, and a love of chess to produce what truly can be called the magnum opus of blindfold chess.

<p>On March 1, 2010, International Master <strong>Jeremy Silman</strong> wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
"What a wonderful book! ... one of the best chess books I've ever seen, and it justifiably won the Cramer Award for best chess book in 2009. In my view, this is something that should be in every player's library ... Easy to read, compelling and fun, it's so rich in fascinating information that it literally blows one's mind. Both Eliot Hearst and John Knott deserve my deepest congratulations for this magnificent achievement."

<p>In its Autumn 2009 issue, <em>Kingpin Chess</em> wrote, "A superb piece of work ... written with enthusiasm ... definitive ... a landmark book."</p>

<p>On January 8, 2009, ChessBase News wrote that the book was "of widespread interest throughout all parts of the chess world. <em>Blindfold Chess</em> ... is by far the most detailed study ever made of this fascinating subject."</p>

<p>Grandmaster <strong>Lubomir Kavalek</strong> wrote in <em>The Washington Post</em> on December 22, 2008, that "<em>Blindfold Chess</em> is the most comprehensive and unique work on the subject."</p>

<p>On February 7, 2009, Grandmaster <strong>Raymond Keene</strong> stated in <em>The Times</em> of London that "in chess the most extreme manifestation of memory power is the blindfold simultaneous display ... [This] new book… will be of great value to those interested in extreme mental performance in general."</p>

<p>On May 2, 2009, the <strong><em>Financial Times</em></strong> wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
Blindfold chess is the game's dark art. ... Until now this has been a poorly documented field, but <em>Blindfold Chess</em> by Eliot Hearst and John Knott is a fine work of authoritative and detailed scholarship, which is also a splendid and fascinating read.
</blockquote>

<p>On March 27, 2009, the <em>Guardian</em> columnist <strong>Leonard Barden</strong> wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
A recently published book which is sure to become the authoritative work on chess without sight of the board. Hearst is a fine writer and player who once beat Bobby Fischer, and this is a fascinatingly readable account of blindfold from Philidor through the record-breakers who took on 30+ opponents at once up to the current Amber events.
</blockquote>

<p>In a book roundup in its February 2009 issue, <strong><em>British Chess Magazine</em></strong> included a capsule review of <em>Blindfold Chess</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
We are dealing with no ordinary book. This is a ... deeply researched, lovingly produced and definitive enquiry into an area of chess with a view to being the last word on the subject. The book goes into every area of blindfold chess, its history, the philosophy and mind techniques involved, the statistics, and 444 annotated games.
</blockquote>

<p>On June 20, 2009, the <strong><em>Winnipeg Free Press</em></strong> published a review of <em>Blindfold Chess</em> that included the following passage:</p>

<blockquote>
This fascinating field (blindfold chess) is exhaustively chronicled in a wonderful new book from McFarland and Company publishers… It would be hard to imagine a more thorough and authoritative text on this subject. Authors Eliot Hearst and John Knott know their stuff… If you like chess books, it will be very hard not to love this one…
