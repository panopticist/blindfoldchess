<h1>Buy the Book</h1>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The original printing of approximately 1,000 copies of the hardcover version of this book has been virtually exhausted and can be obtained with difficulty and usually at relatively great expense, new or used, from a few individuals and websites and/or bookstore chessbook sellers. We are pleased that so many readers were interested in our book and that it received such good reviews all around the world.</p>

<p>But the latest news is good! On February 25, 2013, McFarland published a softcover edition of the book, which is an exact replica of the hardcover version and at a much lower price. You can obtain this paperback reprint of the book at Barnes & Noble and other booksellers' websites or stores.</p>
