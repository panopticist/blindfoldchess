# Images Folder

This folder should contain the images from your Squarespace site.

## Required Images:

1. **alekhine.jpg** - Alexander Alekhine playing blindfold against 28 opponents in Paris (used on homepage)
2. **philidor_exhibition.jpg** - François-André Philidor playing blindfolded at Parsloe's Chess Club (used on excerpt page)
3. **alekhine-blindfold.jpg** - Alexander Alekhine playing blindfold in 1925 (used on excerpt page)

## How to Add Images:

You can download these images from your current Squarespace site:

1. Visit https://www.blindfoldchess.net/
2. Right-click on the images
3. Save them to your computer
4. Place them in this `assets/images/` folder
5. Keep the same filenames as referenced in the pages

Alternatively, you can use the Squarespace URLs directly by replacing `/assets/images/filename.jpg` with the full Squarespace CDN URLs in the markdown files.

## Image URLs from Squarespace:

If you want to reference the Squarespace images directly (temporary solution):

- Alekhine: https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f344174dccc2722aface841/1597274290093-PHWI1U6BAWH1COX6L0OA/alekhine.jpg
- Philidor: https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f344174dccc2722aface841/1597273654124-N4Z2A0PNFQDB5CUVJC43/philidor_exhibition.jpg
- Alekhine Blindfold: https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f344174dccc2722aface841/1597273955778-D6YHSV0O9YVKRO00CIQ1/alekhine.jpg

Note: It's better to host images yourself rather than relying on external URLs.
