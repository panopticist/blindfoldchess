Many chess teachers and writers recommend practice at blindfold chess as a way of developing one's regular chess skill. They also advise players to mentally "play over" complete games or games from diagrammed positions in magazines or newspapers with the remaining moves given in chess notation.

Grandmaster Alexander Beliavsky, among others, has the habit of carefully analyzing a number of games every day without the sight of any chessboard. Techniques of these kinds were a part of the training procedures used in the Soviet Union for accelerating a promising youngster's growth as a chess player, and today they have been adopted by many teachers in other countries.

This blog explores the benefits of blindfold practice and provides practical advice for incorporating it into your training routine.
