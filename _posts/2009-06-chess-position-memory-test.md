How well can you remember chess positions? This blog provides a test of position memory based on psychological research into how chess players process and remember positions.

The test reveals interesting differences between how masters and amateurs encode chess information. Strong players remember meaningful positions far better than random arrangements of pieces, demonstrating that their superior memory is based on pattern recognition rather than raw memorization ability.

Try the test yourself and see how your visualization skills compare!
