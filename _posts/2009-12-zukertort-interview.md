Johannes Zukertort, one of the strongest players of the 19th century and a formidable blindfold player, gave a fascinating interview about his approach to playing without sight of the board.

Zukertort described his visualization methods and the mental techniques he used to keep track of multiple games simultaneously. His insights provide a valuable historical perspective on blindfold chess from one of its greatest practitioners.
