Kenneth Rogoff, the prominent Harvard economist and former Chief Economist at the International Monetary Fund, was also an International Grandmaster in chess. Less well known is his ability as a blindfold player.

As a teenager, Rogoff was a chess prodigy who competed at the highest levels. His experience with visualization and blindfold play contributed to his ability to think systematically about complex economic problems.

This blog explores the connection between chess ability, blindfold visualization, and success in other intellectual fields.
