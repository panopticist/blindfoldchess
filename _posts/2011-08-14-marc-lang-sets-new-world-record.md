Several of my previous blogs have described German FIDE master Marc Lang's exploits at playing many blindfold games simultaneously. In that type of exhibition he played 35 at once last November, surpassing the previous European record of 34 games set by George Koltanowski at Edinburgh, Scotland in 1937. He intends to play 46 games in the same manner in November 2011, to beat the current world record of 45 set by GM Miguel Najdorf in 1947 in São Paulo, Brazil.

Meanwhile, he has just broken the world record for playing many rapid blindfold games in succession, not simultaneously. In 1951 Koltanowski decided to play far more than 10 consecutive games at the same speed and took on 50 relatively weak players in San Francisco, later extending this to 56 games (+50, =6).

Lang played 60 successive rapid games in which each player had a total of 5 minutes available; for a 40-move game this averages out to fewer than 10 seconds a move. The display took 14 hours and Lang won 45, drew 11, and lost 4 against fairly strong opposition.

Lang wrote that he thought of his achievement not so much as setting a new "world record" as just plain fun! Marc Lang runs a computer business and is therefore very familiar with various ways of programming computers to handle both simultaneous and successive blindfold events. He decided a few years ago that he would never have the time to try to achieve an IM or GM rating by traveling to one regular tourney after another, but could establish a chess reputation via blindfold exhibitions.
