Alexander Alekhine's blindfold chess ability was legendary. This blog examines psychological studies of how Alekhine visualized positions and what this reveals about the nature of chess expertise.

Alekhine described his blindfold imagery as involving abstract "forces" rather than concrete pieces and squares. This account matches what other top blindfold players have reported—their visualization becomes more abstract and less pictorial as their skill increases.

Understanding how masters like Alekhine processed chess information has implications for psychology, cognitive science, and chess training methods.
