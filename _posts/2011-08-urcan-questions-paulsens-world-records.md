Chess historian Olimpiu G. Urcan has raised important questions about the authenticity of Louis Paulsen's reported blindfold world records from the 1850s-1860s. Our book discusses Paulsen's remarkable achievements, but Urcan's research suggests that some of the reported numbers may have been exaggerated or misreported in contemporary accounts.

This blog examines the evidence and discusses the implications for blindfold chess history.
