***September 19, 2013*** • **By Eliot Hearst**

American grandmaster Timur Gareyev, who emigrated from Uzbekistan a few years ago, is now one of the top tournament players in the U.S. The 25-year-old won the North American Open in 2012 and tied for third in this year's regular U.S. Championship. With a B.A. degree in Business Marketing from the University of Texas at Brownsville, he has been actively promoting scholastic chess as well as his own achievements in playing blindfold chess.

His frequent blindfold displays, so far all west of the Mississippi River, have produced the greatest interest in that kind of play by an American since George Koltanowski's glory days touring the U.S. from the late 1930's to the 1950's. Before settling in San Francisco, Koltanowski twice set world records for number of opponents played simultaneously without sight of any boards or pieces, by opposing 30 in Antwerp, Belgium in 1931 and 34 in Edinburgh, Scotland in 1937.

According to numerous media reports, Gareev has played as many as 27 and 33 games simultaneously while literally blindfolded and facing toward his opponents, instead of simply playing with his back to them, as is customary. His 27-board display took place in Oahu, Hawaii in December 2012 and he won 24, lost only 1, and drew 2 of the games, a truly excellent score.

## The "Simultaneous" Question

As a result of correspondence with Gareev himself and a few scattered phrases in media reports, I discovered that **one very important condition had not been met.** The games in his 27- and 33-board displays, as well as in most other displays he has given of more than 12 boards, did not all start at the same time! This violates the label of "simultaneous"; in all previous important blindfold simuls every opponent was seated and began play at the beginning of the event.

In the Hawaii display he started with 10 players, 10 more players joined the opposition after another hour and a half, and the final 7 entered after another hour. In the St. Louis display 18 players started at 9 AM, 6-8 more at 10:15 AM, and the final 7-9 at 11:30 AM. Gareev calls this method of staggering the entry of players the use of "waves"; other equally applicable words might be "stages" or "steps" or "phases".

## Why This Matters

Besides not conforming to the definition of "simultaneous", why is this difference important and why does it make the exhibitor's task easier than starting all games at the same time? All previous blindfold champions have stated that the first 10-15 moves of a game are the hardest to handle. The games all start in the same position and the exhibitor needs to make individual games distinctive as soon as possible to avoid confusion among them. With successive "waves" of players an exhibitor could make the current games reasonably distinctive before the next wave began.

In correspondence with me, Gareev was very honest about the advantage of playing his displays in "waves", rather than beginning all of the games at once. He wrote that he realizes his method would never be accepted if he were going to set a world record; all games would have to start at the same time. He also confirmed that it becomes easier to handle the games as they go beyond the opening. Here are some quotes from his writings:

> "The positions become more distinct"  
> "The initial stage of games takes forever"  
> "Remembering the initial moves ... is insanely slow and exhausting"  
> "The initial stage is like shooting a rocket into space. Most of the energy is used to get the rocketship off the ground, the rest is much easier"

## Looking Forward

Despite the fact that Gareev's recent displays were not really "simultaneous", his performances have still been quite impressive and my opinion is that he has an excellent chance to set a new world simultaneous blindfold record once he starts playing under the standard conditions that have been in force for 2 or 3 centuries. He states that he has been spending hundreds of hours studying memory techniques and playing blindfold games at various speeds. His enthusiasm is contagious and he seems to be as devoted to popularizing blindfold chess as no other American has been for at least 50 years.

We look forward to his future blindfold exploits.
