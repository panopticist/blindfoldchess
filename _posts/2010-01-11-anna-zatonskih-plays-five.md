In the years we spent researching our book on Blindfold Chess we never discovered any report of a scheduled, well-regulated multi-board blindfold simultaneous display by a woman, although we do mention some individual games that women played without sight of the board (see pp.136-138 of the book and the games section). We asked the eminent chess historian Edward Winter if he had knowledge of such a performance and he could not recall a single case. So in his "Chess Notes" column of August 29, 2009 (CN 6289 at www.chesshistory.com) he asked his large number of readers whether any of them could supply information about a woman's playing more than one or two games under well-controlled conditions. No one responded with an example.

The current women's world champion, Alexandra Kosteniuk, has stated that she could probably manage three or four blindfold games at the same time, but has never really tried to play more than three (see her September 7, 2009 blog at www.chessblog.com). Apparently these three were not played under well-controlled, serious conditions, but were relatively informal. Therefore it seems very likely that the 5-board display recently given by U.S. Women's Champion Anna Zatonskih is the first instance of an organized, refereed, formal multi-board simultaneous blindfold display by a woman. It was played in St. Louis in October, 2009 just before the start of the U.S. Women's Championship, which was won by the defending champion, Anna herself, who has now won that championship three times. Throughout her exhibition Anna actually wore a blindfold, which was used for its dramatic effect since all her opponents were behind her and so she could not see any of the board positions anyway.

Woman GM Jennifer Shahade, one of the organizers of all the events connected with the championship (she did not enter the competition this time), devised a very original and clever idea to further promote blindfold chess during the festivities in St. Louis—a scheme that involved all 10 entrants in the tourney playing a single blindfold game together! In drawing numbers to determine the round-robin pairings in the championship, a necessary preliminary in all such tourneys, each woman picked a scarf from one of ten available. The players made their choices in a predetermined random order. Each scarf had a hidden number stitched on it, which would be the number assigned the player who chose it. Then the 10 players were blindfolded and sat in a row of numbered chairs that alternated in color. Number 1 started the group blindfold game by calling out her move (White's first move) and then Number 2, seated next to Number 1, responded with Black's first move, and so on, with the odd-numbered players composing the White team and the even-numbered players the Black team. The game was played rapidly and Black won eventually when a White player blundered away a queen. The White team had to resign and the crowd watching this spectacle gave all 10 women a standing ovation.

Here are the five games from the display, which took about two hours. In my opinion Anna made no real mistakes in the entire event. She played rather cautiously and took very few risks, which is generally a good strategy in multi-board simultaneous blindfold exhibitions, anyway. Note that all five opponents were males! (Jennifer Shahade tells me that they had planned to include at least one strong woman player among the opposition but their first choice got sick and other available women were registered for a different event. The organizing committee then figured that from a feminist point of view it might even be more striking to have only male opponents. This decision could have backfired if Anna had scored poorly in the display, but she won all five games). The USCF ratings of the opponents ranged from approximately 1500-1800.

A good number of colorful photos (snapped by Betsy Dynako)and more about the blindfold exhibition, the drawing-of-lots setup followed by the 10-person blindfold game, and other festivities can be found in [Jennifer Shahade's article on the USCF website](http://main.uschess.org/content/view/9757/141/). All of the events were sponsored by the Chess Club and Scholastic Chess Center of St. Louis, founded and funded primarily by Rex Sinquefield, who gave Anna Zatonskih her toughest battle (see Game 5 above).
