Joe Lux writes to tell us the following:

> Back in the late seventies, Fred Townsend organized the New England Blindfold Championship in CT. It had 6 entries, none from CT! I tied for first, but had lost the games long ago. That was the only such event I have seen since.

We would be very interested to hear from other readers who know of blindfold tourneys that have been held but are now "forgotten." Please send such items for posting on this website by using the contact email beneath the above item.
