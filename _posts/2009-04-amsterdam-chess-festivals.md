The annual Amber blindfold and rapid chess tournaments brought together the world's elite players for a unique competition format. Originally held in Amsterdam from 1988-1999, then moving to Monaco, these tournaments featured top grandmasters playing both blindfold and rapid games.

The Amber tournaments helped demonstrate that the world's strongest players could maintain high-quality play in blindfold conditions. Players like Anand, Kramnik, Ivanchuk, and Morozevich regularly competed.

This blog examines the history of the Amber tournaments and their contribution to modern blindfold chess.
