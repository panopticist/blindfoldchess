Canada has maintained a strong interest in blindfold chess, but one sad story involves Hans Jung's attempt to set the Canadian record for total number of simultaneous blindfold opponents.

By playing 26 at once in 1993, he attempted to beat what he thought was the Canadian record of 25 games, set by Leo Williams in 1982. To his great surprise Jung soon afterwards discovered that Williams had exceeded his own record by playing 27 opponents in 1986.

So a few weeks after his 26-board display Jung arranged a 30-board display at a different mall in London, Ontario. Two hours after that exhibition began, a punk rock band began blasting out music for a CD promotion release at a nearby record store. Since very noisy surroundings make blindfold displays almost impossible to give, the exhibition had to be stopped.

This unfortunate incident prevented Jung from achieving what would have been a significant Canadian record.
