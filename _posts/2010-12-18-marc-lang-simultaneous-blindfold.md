Over the course of the last year and a half we have written two blogs on Marc Lang's successive and dramatic increases in the number of blindfold games he has played all at once. He moved from playing 15 simultaneously to setting a new German record of 23, and now he has played 35 at once, surpassing blindfold champion George Koltanowski's still-existing European and pre-Najdorf world record of 34 simultaneous games set in Edinburgh in 1937.

The exhibition was held in Sontheim an der Brenz, Germany on November 27-28, 2010. Lang sat in the same room as his opponents with his back to them. He transmitted his moves by typing them in algebraic notation on a computer monitor and receiving his opponent's moves from the referee.

Lang had the added task of typing moves into a computer, which apparently did not distract him from his major task of playing 35 games simultaneously! The use of a computer-projector arrangement like this was a novel way of conducting a blindfold display and it probably helped prevent incorrect transmission of moves.

Lang's next goal: to beat Miguel Najdorf's world record of 45 games set in 1947.
