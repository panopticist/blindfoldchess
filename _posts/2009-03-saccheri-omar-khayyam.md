The connections between chess, mathematics, and logical thinking have been explored by scholars for centuries. Mathematician Gerolamo Saccheri and poet-mathematician Omar Khayyam both had connections to chess culture in their respective eras.

This blog examines how chess ability, particularly blindfold visualization, relates to mathematical and geometric reasoning. Many strong chess players have also excelled in mathematics, suggesting overlapping cognitive skills.

The ability to manipulate abstract patterns mentally—essential for both blindfold chess and mathematics—may explain this connection.
