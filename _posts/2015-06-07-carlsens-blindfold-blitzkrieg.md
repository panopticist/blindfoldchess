The setting was unusual for a blindfold simultaneous chess exhibition by a grandmaster. It was held at the 20th anniversary of the annual Sohn Investment Conference, which is the world's largest meeting of prominent financial experts: investors, hedge-fund managers, and bankers. Each member of the audience, with the exception of a few special invitees, had to pay $5,000 for the opportunity to attend; most of the over $4 million that was raised is to be used to support research in and treatment of childhood cancer. Held at Avery Fischer Hall in Lincoln Center in New York, the event usually features numerous speakers on financial issues, but this time Magnus Carlsen's blindfold display may have created as much attention as many of the speeches.

Carlsen's exhibition on May 4 was an unexpected treat for most of the attendees. What he was willing to attempt was probably the most difficult clock-blindfold display ever played.

## History of Timed Blindfold Chess

In the 1940s GM Reuben Fine, who was an excellent blindfold player but never tried to set a world record for total number of games played at once, introduced some new innovations that involved rapid and clock blindfold games. In 1944 at the Washington Chess Divan he played 10 consecutive blindfold games against sighted players at 10-seconds-a-move vs. some of the best players in Washington, including Hans Berliner, who later became the world correspondence chess champion. His opponents also had 10 seconds to respond to his announced moves. He scored +9, =1.

Another of Fine's innovations was "clock-blindfold-chess". He played 6 simultaneous games in 1945 at the rate of 20 moves an hour and so the display was equivalent to six tourney games played at the same time. His sighted opponents had to play their single games at the same rate.

Later on, in 1985 Garry Kasparov played 10 strong opponents simultaneously without sight of any board or pieces in Hamburg, Germany with a "clock-chess" time limit of 40 moves in 2 hours on each board, winning 8 and drawing 2. To my knowledge, he never gave another blindfold display. Garry once declared that he avoided blindfold chess because "I don't want to become mad!"

George Koltanowski in San Francisco in 1960 beat his previous record by handling 56 sighted successive opponents in games at 10-seconds-a-move (+50, =6). Just a few years ago (July 2011) Marc Lang of Germany broke Kolty's record by playing 60 successive rapid games in which each player had a total of 5 minutes available; for a 40-move game this averages out to fewer than 10 seconds a move. Lang won 45, drew 11, and lost 4 against fairly strong opposition.

## Carlsen's Achievement

I hope that this brief review of the history of timed blindfold chess provides a comparative context for evaluating Carlsen's recent display. He had a total of only 9 minutes to play 3 opponents, who each had 9 minutes to complete all their moves. They could make their moves at any time, not in succession from Boards 1-3, and so Magnus might have two moves from different games announced to him within a split-second.

He usually responded to all moves within a second or two, much faster than in any previous blindfold display. He was never clearly told how much of his total 9 minutes he had consumed at a given time, which seems a little unfair to him. But, unfazed, he went on to win all 3 games without using up his 9 minutes. Before the match he was asked whether he was ready for such a competition and he replied "I haven't done this before so I wouldn't know." He made no illegal moves in the entire display.

This was a remarkable achievement!
