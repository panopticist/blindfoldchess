In the current issue of *New in Chess* (#2, 2009), Hans Ree describes a little-publicized series of blindfold exhibitions that took place for a decade in Amsterdam. They were the "main course" in an annual festival that was held in a tent set up on Spui Square in the center of town. In the mornings a regular blitz tourney was held to select four players to participate in a simultaneous blindfold display given later that day by a grandmaster against five opponents. The fifth player was a "mystery guest" who might be a politician, artist, or a strong player. Many people walking in that crowded area stopped to watch the action in the blindfold exhibition. It was a real attention-getter.

Similar events have been held at several places in the U.S. and elsewhere (including my current home, Tucson, Arizona). Other locations around the world might want to think about holding such festivals to publicize chess in general and the chess activities available there. Of course it would be difficult in many places to find an experienced enough and strong enough blindfold player to take on five opponents at once, but even a single blindfold game in a public setting would be a real spectacle and attract attention to chess. Recall that when Philidor played only two games blindfolded in the 18th century he amazed the audiences that watched him and he became a national celebrity in France.

Amsterdam has had many local grandmasters who could handle five blindfold games at once, but sometimes players from outside The Netherlands were also paid to give the display. The last two festivals were moved from Spui Square to VondelPark. These Amsterdam festivals ended in 1999 because of a loss of sponsorship to handle the expenses for the event.

Ree lists the blindfolded players who played their five opponents in each year the festival was held. The list of grandmasters is impressive (including two players who have held the world championship). Here are their names and scores against the strong opposition they faced (there was no event in 1997):

1988: Sosonko 2.5-2.5  
1989: Timman 3.5-1.5   
1990: Korchnoi 1-4 (the only minus score by any exhibitor!)  
1991: Anand 4-1  
1992: Karpov 3.5-1.5  
1993: Van der Wiel 3.5-1.5  
1994: Ivan Sokolov 4-1  
1995: Jussupow 4-1  
1996: Predag Nikolic 5-0  
1998:Van Wely 3-2  
1999: Shirov 3-2

Very few games from these relatively informal events appear in the vast blindfold-chess databases we possess, but here are three that we were able to locate. Unfortunately or fortunately, two of these involve losses by the exhibitor. But losses can be very instructive, too.
