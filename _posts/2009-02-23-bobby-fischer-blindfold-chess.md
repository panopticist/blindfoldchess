In our book Bobby Fischer is only rarely mentioned and, strangely enough, never in any direct connection with blindfold chess. This omission was mainly due to Bobby's failure to play any serious, formal blindfold games or exhibitions. However, friends were familiar with his playing without sight of any board and pieces in all kinds of informal settings: taking a walk, riding on a train or plane, having dinner, partying, or relaxing on a day off in a tournament. His master opponents often had no chess set available, either. Virtually none of the scores of those many games were recorded for posterity. But, to no one's surprise, Bobby was a formidable blindfold player.

## New Year's Eve 1963

Frank Brady, in *Profile of a Prodigy* (1973, p. 76), narrates the story of Bobby's participation in a New Year's Eve party at Jack Collins's home on December 31, 1963, when Bobby had one game to go (on January 2, with Anthony Saidy) to finish the regular U.S. Championship with an 11-0 score — perfection that had never before been achieved in our national championship.

Right after ringing in the new year, Bobby played a good number of blindfold games at the party with the strong master Billy Addison (also a player in the ongoing U. S. Championship) under conditions where Addison had sight of a chess board and pieces. Bobby allowed Addison to play White in every game and, in addition, Bobby took off his king's bishop's pawn at the start of each game as an extra handicap. Each player had only five minutes per game. Brady reports that Addison "barely managed to break even" in their series. Brady remarks that "it was a memorable chess experience for all of us to witness."

## High School Days

Brady also reports (pp. 21-22) that a fellow classmate of Bobby's in high school recalled years later that Bobby:

> was always quiet and disinterested in the lesson. Occasionally, he would take out his pocket chess set and play over some games. Invariably, he would be caught by the teacher, who would say: "Fischer, I can't force you to listen to the lesson and I can't prevent you from playing chess, but for my sake, please play without the board." Bobby would courteously put his pocket set away and sit there in stony silence, and we all knew, including the teacher, that he was playing the games in his mind.

## Games with Jack Collins

Jack Collins recalls more examples of Bobby's blindfold play in his book *My Seven Chess Prodigies* (1974, for example, pp. 37-39). In June of 1956 Bobby started to appear regularly at Collins's home (called the Hawthorne Chess Club), where the two played many fast games of regular chess. But on Tuesday nights they would be driven over to the Marshall Chess Club to play in the marathon (often 20 entrants) weekly rapid-transit tourneys there, conducted at 10 seconds per move. During the drive Fischer and Collins would play each other without any chess set available to either of them. Even though not all these games were ever finished, Collins said "they were fun, and they provided worthwhile training in visualization." Collins also describes their frequent double-blindfold games on their way to see a movie together.

## Games with Washington Masters

Recently Richard Cantwell, one of Washington's strongest players for many years, wrote me that he vividly recalls the time when Bobby stayed at his home for a couple of days when he was scheduled to give a regular large-scale simultaneous exhibition and lecture in Washington in the early 1960s. Cantwell invited Senior Masters Hans Berliner and Eliot Hearst, both frequent winners of the District of Columbia Championship, over for dinner and some chess with Bobby. The two agreed to play Bobby with sight of a board and pieces while he played "blindfolded" with his back to them and no board or pieces. These were offhand games, with no clocks, but they were played relatively quickly, one opponent at a time. Cantwell did not keep the scores of the two games but he remembers that Berliner played a Caro-Kann Defense and lost while Hearst managed to hold on for a draw.

## A Question for Readers

Perhaps readers can help us obtain the details about a game that Bobby supposedly played while he had a chess set and pieces in front of him and Sammy Reshevsky played blindfolded. Lou Hayes's book *Bobby Fischer: Complete Games of the American World Chess Champion* (1992, p. 297) supplies a game that was "played at 10 seconds per move with Reshevsky blindfolded" on June 13, 1957, which Bobby also won.

We would welcome submission of other Fischer blindfold games and any stories or comments readers may have about his play without sight of the board.
