Most of you have probably witnessed a regular simultaneous display given by one person and you understand exactly how it is conducted. To be sure you know the details of such an arrangement an example may be useful. At the start of, say, a 20-board "simul" the exhibitor walks successively from Board 1 to Board 20, usually taking White and making the first move in each game. Then he returns to Board 1 and answers each opponent's reply in succession. This general procedure continues as various games are finished. On the other hand, in a standard tandem display (also known as "leapfrog chess" or "piggy-back chess") two exhibitors alternate moves so that after one exhibitor completes his moves on all boards the second exhibitor takes over and plays the next move on every board. Then the first player takes over again on all boards, followed by the second player on all boards, and so forth as the number of games in progress of course diminishes due to wins, draws, or (heaven forbid) losses by the partnership. The partners are never allowed to consult with each other, except when a decision has to be made about whether to accept or offer a draw, or to resign. The important point is that neither player ever makes two successive moves in any game.

Over the centuries there have apparently been only two recorded examples of a blindfold exhibition conducted in this way, because few strong blindfold players have had another strong blindfold player available or willing to play by such a method: Not only do you have to recall your own and your opponents' moves , but also to recall the moves of your partner as well as to discern and try to cooperate — if possible, acceptable and clear to you — with the plan or threats your partner intended by his last move or series of moves.

Both these previous recorded attempts at tandem blindfold chess occurred in 1934, more than 80 years before the one to be described shortly in this blog post, in 2015 by Timur Gareyev and Marc Lang. Each of the two earlier ones involved the regular and blindfold world champion, Alexander Alekhine, whom most chess historians and blindfold experts consider the strongest ever individual blindfold player (I agree). Early in 1934 Alekhine teamed with Dutch chessmaster Salo Landau (1903-1944) in Rotterdam to play six pairs of strong consulting opponents who of course had regular boards and pieces in front of them. The Alekhine-Landau duo scored 2 wins, 3 losses, and 1 draw — nothing to boast about.

A few weeks later, Alekhine convinced the immediately previous world blindfold champion to partner with him. This master was George Koltanowski, who played 30 games at once by himself in 1931, only to be eclipsed by Alekhine's 32 in 1933; later Koltanowski recaptured the world blindfold championship by playing 34 in 1937. The two of them conducted a tandem display in Antwerp against six teams, each consisting of four very strong players who could consult about move selection. Alekhine stated that he considered Koltanowski at that time to be the second best blindfold player in the world, after him of course. Koltanowski has written about his apprehension in combining forces with the great Alekhine and said after the exhibition that he was much more tired than if he had played 30 regular simultaneous blindfold games! Together they scored quite well, winning 3, losing 1, and drawing 2. All six games are given in our book (Games 326-331).

Now direct your attention to the only recent "tandem" display, one in which simultaneous blindfold champion FM Marc Lang of Germany, who holds the current world record for number of blindfold games played at once by an individual (46 in 2011), teamed up with GM Timur Gareyev of the U.S., who has been giving many blindfold displays here and overseas and hopes to break Lang's record by playing 50 opponents at once by himself in Chicago in 2016. Despite the fact that they are strong competitors for the individual world record and their styles of play differ, could they get along well enough to work together and handle a tandem blindfold exhibition? Gareyev is a young, unconventional grandmaster, whose clothes, hair, and general personality make him stand out in a crowd, whereas Lang is a hard-working family man with a very successful computer business and a chess title of FIDE master (he has concentrated on blindfold chess because his family and business have prevented his traveling around to major tournaments to gain an IM or GM title; his blindfold displays have all been conducted near where he lives). And they met each other only a few days before giving their exhibition in Sontheim, Germany last July 31! Gareyev could meet Lang in person at that time since Gareyev occasionally visits his married sister who lives only a few minutes away from Lang's hometown of Günzburg. Both Gareyev and his sister are originally from Uzbekistan. Gareyev is 27 years old and Lang 45.

They decided to play 7 opponents in their exhibition, one more than in Alekhine's two tandem displays. The display started around 7 pm and lasted until shortly after midnight, with two 5-minute breaks. Note that they took the black pieces in one game. As is fairly typical in blindfold play the games were not very complicated tactical struggles and "safety-first" was a general guiding principle. All the game scores are supplied at the end of this article and you can decide whether my description is accurate. Neither Lang nor Gareyev made any illegal moves or major blunders. They won 5 and drew 2 of the games against their opponents, all of whom were members of Lang's home club and whose FIDE ratings averaged a little over 1600, ranging from 1144 to 2109 (you can add about 200-250 points to convert these numbers to USCF ratings).

Lang writes that this was "the very first time" he has played with an actual blindfold. Previously, when conducting a blindfold exhibition by himself (including the times when he set European and world simultaneous records) he used a computer setup where he could type in his moves and receive his opponents' replies on the monitor facing him. In that kind of arrangement he could see his opponents in the distance and chat with them, but the actual boards and pieces in front of his opponents were barricaded by cardboard blocks so he could not see the positions. Of course on the monitor he could see only his opponent's last move and his reply to that, not the entire game. He writes that he felt uncomfortable using a blindfold and that it prevented his associating positions with faces and names, which helps him to differentiate among games. And he added that he didn't like sitting in the darkness all the time!

On the other hand, Gareyev has always used a blindfold and asks his opponents to call out their moves to him, as was also the case throughout the tandem display Their different voices help him to differentiate among games. Thus Lang prefers visual cues to aid his performance and Gareyev auditory ones. I should point out that in virtually all individual world record performances before Lang's the exhibitor either sat with his back to his opponents or was situated in a separate room, and moves were transmitted to him by a referee or set of referees. This arrangement seems to me the "purest" form of simultaneous blindfold play, because the exhibitor has no visual or auditory cues to help him differentiate among games — only the board number.

With respect to the tandem display, Lang's only regret was that he had to work at his business center the entire day and he became fairly exhausted after the first two hours of play. He wrote me that he considered this "somehow unprofessional". However, Gareyev was fresh and Lang was still able to concentrate well enough throughout the exhibition to make good moves and avoid any major mistakes.

Gareyev and Lang turned out to like each other very much, enjoyed similar kinds of humorous remarks, and developed great respect for the other's blindfold ability. They are considering giving more tandem exhibitions and Gareyev hopes to lure Lang to the U.S. for some of them. Lang believes that Gareyev may be able to beat his world record for individual simultaneous blindfold play in his planned exhibition against 50 players in Chicago in 2016. His only reservations about that possibility involve his feeling that Gareyev may not work hard enough beforehand on developing powerful memory systems to differentiate among so many games. He writes that if Gareyev does set a new world record he may well try to play 64 games in 2017 and regain the world record.

Gareyev argued that by playing 7 games they could claim the world record for number of opponents encountered in a tandem display. My opinion is that this claim is somewhat unwarranted because there are so few examples of tandem blindfold play that "records" are not kept for this type of exhibition. A more critical point as to whether their performance constituted a new world record involves the fact that the display did not conform to conventional rules for tandem simultaneous exhibitions, as adhered to by Alekhine and those who have given tandem exhibitions in which neither exhibitor was blindfolded. Gareyev convinced Lang that they should alternate moves not by one player playing all 7 opponents in a row and then the other player taking over for the next 7 moves, etc., — the conventional method — but by actually alternating moves as they played the 7 opponents, that is, for example, Gareyev would move on Board 1, Lang on Board 2, Gareyev on Board 3, Lang on Board 4, etc., up to Gareyev moving on Board 7, and then Lang on Board 1. Unfortunately, this arrangement works whenever an odd number of players remain but not for an even number. To illustrate the problem: After one game was finished, and 6 players were left, this system of alternation forces one exhibitor to make successive moves on Boards 1, 3, and 5 and the other exhibitor successive moves on Boards 2, 4, and 6. A tandem display has always required that no player would ever make successive moves on the same board. Lang and Gareyev realized this quickly after the first game was finished and Lang later said the method was "bad" compared to the more "logical and clean" standard tandem arrangement, but they had to stick to it once play had begun. That is why I have often put quotation marks around the word "tandem" as it applies to this exhibition.

I have not described the games or the arrangement of the playing room in detail because I believe the following six photos and seven game scores will give the reader all that is needed to fill in those kinds of gaps in my presentation and still keep the text of this blog post within reasonable space limits.
