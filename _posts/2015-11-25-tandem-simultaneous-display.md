Both previous recorded attempts at tandem blindfold chess occurred in 1934, more than 80 years before this 2015 display by Timur Gareyev and Marc Lang. Each of the two earlier ones involved the regular and blindfold world champion, Alexander Alekhine.

Now direct your attention to the only recent "tandem" display, one in which simultaneous blindfold champion FM Marc Lang of Germany, who holds the current world record for number of blindfold games played at once by an individual (46 in 2011), teamed up with GM Timur Gareyev of the U.S., who has been giving many blindfold displays and hopes to break Lang's record.

Despite the fact that they are strong competitors for the individual world record and their styles of play differ, could they get along well enough to work together and handle a tandem blindfold exhibition?

Gareyev is a young, unconventional grandmaster, whose clothes, hair, and general personality make him stand out in a crowd, whereas Lang is a hard-working family man with a very successful computer business. And they met each other only a few days before giving their exhibition in Sontheim, Germany last July 31!

They decided to play 7 opponents in their exhibition, one more than in Alekhine's two tandem displays. The display started around 7 pm and lasted until shortly after midnight, with two 5-minute breaks. Neither Lang nor Gareyev made any illegal moves or major blunders. They won 5 and drew 2 of the games.

Gareyev and Lang turned out to like each other very much, enjoyed similar kinds of humorous remarks, and developed great respect for the other's blindfold ability. They are considering giving more tandem exhibitions and Gareyev hopes to lure Lang to the U.S. for some of them.

Lang writes that this was "the very first time" he has played with an actual blindfold.
