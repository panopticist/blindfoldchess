International Master Anna Zatonskih, the U.S. Women's Champion, demonstrated her blindfold chess ability by playing five simultaneous games without sight of the boards. While not attempting any records, her performance showcased the strong visualization skills required at the highest levels of women's chess.

Blindfold displays by top female players have been relatively rare, making Zatonskih's exhibition particularly noteworthy.
