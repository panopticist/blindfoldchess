Jeff La Hue of California recently sent us the details of an interview he conducted with George Koltanowski, a friend of his, in San Francisco in the early 1990s. Koltanowski set world records for simultaneous blindfold play in 1931 and 1937 by playing 30 and 34 games respectively. La Hue decided to ask the 91-year-old Kolty many of the very same questions Alfred Binet posed to his expert blindfold players.

**Q: Have you in a general way a good memory? Are you good at mental arithmetic, and in the habit of making mental calculations?**

**GK:** I had a near-fatal illness as a child and was bed-ridden for two years enduring fourteen operations. I didn't learn how to play chess, but I used that time to develop my mind by memorizing anything I read. As a youngster I enjoyed geography and mathematics and, later, languages and chess.

The interview provides fascinating insights into how one of history's great blindfold champions thought about his abilities and developed his skills.
