FIDE master Marc Lang, who set a new German record of 23 simultaneous blindfold games last November, has announced that he will attempt something especially spectacular next year: to beat the long-standing world record of 45 games, set over 60 years ago by Grandmaster Miguel Najdorf in São Paulo, Brazil in 1947.

Since no one has apparently played more than 26 simultaneous blindfold games since 1993, Lang will be taking quite a leap forward and doubling the number of games he handled in his 23-board display.

Lang, 40 and married with two young children, is a self-employed computer programmer and antique dealer, too busy with his business and family to play chess professionally. He lives in Günzburg, 60 miles west of Munich in Bavaria.

Lang has remarked that "blindfold is just like I'm used to studying chess". When giving blindfold displays, he reports that he does not visualize boards and pieces, but only "spots" and "functions". This account of "abstract" rather than "concrete" visualization is typical of what experienced blindfold masters of the past have reported.
