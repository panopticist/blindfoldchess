FIDE master Marc Lang of Günzburg, Germany, recently gave a blindfold simultaneous exhibition against 15 opponents, his largest display to date. The exhibition went smoothly and Lang scored well against his opponents.

Lang has announced his intention to attempt to break the German record of 22 simultaneous blindfold games, which was set by British Grandmaster Anthony Miles in Roetgen in 1984. This would be Lang's first step toward even more ambitious goals in blindfold chess.

Lang's approach to blindfold chess is distinctive: he reports visualizing positions in an abstract way rather than seeing actual boards and pieces.
