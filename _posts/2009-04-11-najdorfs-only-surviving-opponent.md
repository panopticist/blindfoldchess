After reading about Najdorf's world-record blindfold simultaneous display against 45 players in our book, Luciano Nilo de Andrade wrote us that we had presented an accurate picture of the exhibition and the results. He knew, because in partnership with Alfredo Schair he had played and lost on Board 27 against Najdorf in that display. Since Andrade may well be the only surviving opponent of Najdorf's from 62 years ago, we asked him to record some of his recollections of the exhibition.

## The Venue

The exhibition took place in the new Galleria Prestes Maia, opened just two years before. It was summertime (January 24, 1947). Sixty years ago the use of air conditioning was not common. Nevertheless, after hours of play Najdorf needed to leave the place, to take a shower and change clothes, because his shirt was wet from perspiration.

## The Simultaneous Display

Before the exhibition began there were the usual introductions by municipal authorities. Then the regulations for the event were loudly read. I will mention two strikingly unusual details. First, on each board of the 45 boards, five players could share in the conduct of the game. Each one could leave the playing area as he or she pleased—so long as one player remained.

My board was the 27th and we were two, I and Alfredo Schair. At that time we were studying at the Brazilian Air Force School. We both possessed what was called Second Category in chess skill at the national level in Brazil.

I remember that on some boards Najdorf announced mate in 3, 4, 5, or 6 moves. Several times he allowed newspaper reporters to interrupt his play and then he would say where the pieces were located in any particular game or announce all the moves in a game up to that point, in exactly the right order.

Admission to the event was free. Before the end all the games were won, only a few were drawn, and none lost by Najdorf. The exhibition proved to be an extraordinary feat. To watch it was a unique experience in my long life. I never will forget it.
