<p>Visualize this scene. A chessmaster sits at an empty table with his back to 20 players, who are arranged in a rectangle behind him and have their own chessboards in front of them. He cannot see any of the 20 positions on his opponents' boards. The boards are numbered consecutively from 1 to 20, in a counterclockwise manner starting from the master's left side. All opponents have the Black pieces and therefore the master has the first move in every game.</p>

<p>He is taking on the 20 opponents at once and calls out his first move on each board in standard chess notation, going quickly around the rectangle from Board 1 to Board 20. The master is very swift in this first go-around because he decided long before the exhibition exactly what his first move was going to be on each board number, and he must have a planned system since he does not play the same first move on all boards.</p>

<p>Now that every one of the 20 players has heard what opening move the master played against him, and each opponent himself (or a referee, also known as a "teller") has actually made the master's initial move on his chessboard, the focus returns to Board 1. Here, the player must be ready with his response, which he makes on the board in front of him. Then the player or referee calls out the move to the exhibitor, who then calls out his second move on that board. The action immediately shifts to Board 2, where the player there must be ready with his first move, which the master then answers quickly with his second move. The play continues in this manner around the 20 boards, until play returns again to Board 1 where the opponent has to make his second move, which is called out to the master, who then calls out his third move.</p>

<p>And so on, perhaps for many, many moves, until every game is finished by the master's either checkmating his opponents on certain boards, forcing his opponents to give up ("resign") on other boards because the position is hopeless, or drawing the game (when both the exhibitor and the player receive half a point). The only other alternative outcomes are that, heaven forbid, the master is checkmated or resigns a game to his opponent, or that an opponent has to leave and is either forfeited or another player is allowed to replace him and continue the game from the position already reached.</p>

<p>Because the master is continually receiving and making moves on the other boards, each opponent has much more time to think than the master, but the sighted player must move as soon as the master "arrives" at his board. The exhibitor may in theory spend as much time as he likes before calling out his move. In practice, however, he will usually answer quite rapidly, for otherwise a 20 board display might last for days. Most games last on the average 20 to 30 minutes (that is, the total time devoted to that particular game, which would depend mainly on the exhibitor's rate of play and the length of the game), so that 20 games might take more than 8 hours to complete.</p>

<h2>The Amazing Achievement</h2>

<p>Many psychologists and informed members of the chess and other communities believe—in our view, justifiably—that the playing of more than 20 or 30 simultaneous blindfold games ranks among the most amazing achievements of human memory. Not only must the master recall the constantly changing positions in all the games, which tend to have an average length of 25 to 40 moves, but he must also find good moves. If he does not win at least 70 percent of the games, the display is not usually considered a success—unless the opposition is extremely strong.</p>

<p>Such well-known authorities as polymath Douglas Hofstadter in the field of artificial intelligence and experimental psychologist Endel Tulving in the field of cognitive neuroscience and human memory have told Hearst that, in their opinion, no other human memory feat can surpass the achievements of the best simultaneous blindfold champions. However, blindfold chess involves more than just memory. Among other things, it calls for a memory that is linked with understanding, expertise, imagery, calculation, and recognition of meaningful configurations or patterns.</p>

<h2>Blindfold Chess Today</h2>

<p>The main form of blindfold play today is in high-class tournaments where individual players compete one-on-one against each other under normal tournament conditions, but through the use of computer technology neither one of them can see the actual position. Sitting a few feet apart, the players type or "click" their moves onto a computer keyboard, and their own monitors merely display an empty diagram and the notation of their opponent's last move. The annual tournament in Monaco, half blindfold and half regular chess, has attracted almost all the very best players in the world.</p>

<p>Noteworthy is the fact that many chess teachers and writers recommend practice at blindfold chess as a way of developing one's regular chess skill. They also advise players to mentally "play over" complete games or games from diagrammed positions in magazines or newspapers with the remaining moves given in chess notation. Grandmaster Alexander Beliavsky, among others, has the habit of carefully analyzing a number of games every day without the sight of any chessboard.</p>
